## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

## To suggest a change/bug and to work on it follow the given steps:
  * Create an issue and describe it properly 
  (or work on an already created issue)
  * Wait for the maintainers to assign it to you 
  (This will make sure that someone else is not already working on it and will save everyone's time)
  * After you've been assigned you can work on it and then create a Pull request to get your changes merged
